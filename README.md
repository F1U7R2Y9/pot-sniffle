## Lessons
- Java is linkable with HTML, but it is probably not a good idea. (at least i know this now)

- On top of that Java is not directly linable but JavaScript helps linking , it can read escape sequence from Java and is able to print it on !DOCTYPE html.

- Folder management and solving messed up things.

- Creative ideas including many different programming languages
